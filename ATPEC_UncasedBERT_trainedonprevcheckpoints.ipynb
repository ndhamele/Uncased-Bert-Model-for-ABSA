      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 0: \" I don ' t want a phone . I find I need a phone . This phone is very good for meeting the need for one . It ' s the right size for me , too , especially if I have to hold it up to my ear for a long period of time . If this happens a lot in the future , I ' ll use my Bluetooth earphones . I did hear that the Jan 2023 update messed Bluetooth connectivity up a bit for use in cars . I ' ll be getting a car with this capability in a couple of months , so I hope that is resolved by then . Unlike my previous Pixel 3a , it ' s waterproof , has an updated OS with improved features ( the pictures are better even though the camera is supposed to be the one used since the Pixel 2 , the Android Assistant is really good , and the shortcuts are convenient - - and programmable ! - - for the most - used features so one can pull the phone out and be taking pictures in about a second now ) and it makes much better use of the available space for the screen . The response is noticeably better than the Pixel 3a , perhaps at the cost of the battery life . The 3a lasted at least a week for me , versus four or five days for the 6a . There were more initial problems with connection reliability than the 3a had , but the 3a didn ' t have 5G support . Maybe there are still growing pains with 5G . I note that the 4G 3a had consistent 4 bars where the 6a struggles to get 2 at the same location , but the phones would use WiFi more than cellular connections there . There may be some provider issues ; I ' m happy with the phone itself . I liked the earphone plug in the 3a , but strangely I don ' t miss the lack , and if that helps the waterproofing of the phone I ' m all for it . The new phone recognizes its orientation much faster than the 3a did , even though I do not have the facial recognition feature enabled for this purpose . But I do miss the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone . The one on the front embedded in the screen feels like a gimmick . It ' s slower to successfully recognize me , and seems faster at acknowledging failures . I did add my thumb this time ; any other finger required two hands to log on to the phone . And maybe it is a security feature , but this OS requires a keypad code a lot more often than the Pixel 3a OS . The Android OS has continually improved safety features with each new version . I ' m not happy that the OS will not be updated after three years , but I do like the five - year security support . \"\n",
      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 1:   \" I read many reviews before buying this . I waded through endless nonsense about playing games and taking selfies to get to factors I needed : voice calls , texts , email , and other apps that actually get things done , and maybe the occasional video or music app . I had high hopes , but I ’ m running into a lot of disappointment so far . Transitioning to stock Android 12 from stock Android 10 was easy . The Pixel ’ s cable and built - in instructions helped import all my old apps , often with settings and data intact . I had to re - enter a few passwords , tweak some settings , etc . but it was far less work than I expected . The immediate Android 13 upgrades were easy , although slow . Some companies make ruggedized , military - grade phones . This isn ’ t one of them , in fact it uses mostly midrange materials . So of course I use a case and screen protector . Well , they say all newer Google phones have a hard time recognizing fingerprints , especially with a screen protector . I set the finger sensitivity to high . No difference . Stored multiple recordings of the same fingerprint to enhance recognizability . No difference . The only help I found came from other reviewers , one of whom suggested rubbing the fingertip on his face to pick up skin oil , or another who advised licking the fingertip to make it wet . These are the low - tech solutions to Google ’ s high - tech design failure . Bottom line : an in - screen sensor is a stupid idea and its performance is just as bad as you ’ ve heard . Maybe you ’ ll get lucky , but be prepared to enter passwords or codes or patterns or some other unlock method . It seems to use power quickly , and definitely charges more slowly than my older , cheaper phone , regardless of charger or cable . No wireless charging and nothing like any kind of actual “ fast ” charging . We have an app through our phone company to locate all phones in the family . It can find a Nokia or Samsung to within 50 - 100 feet . But it struggles to locate this phone at all , and then only to within about 1000 feet , indoors or outdoors . The phone has multiple setting options for location precision , permission , GPS vs . Wifi vs Bluetooth , etc . I ’ ve checked Google help and user forums , phone company help and user forums , reviews etc . Nothing helps , and this is a big deal to me . I used my old phone to listen to music , mono speaker and all . It had a headphone jack of course , and an app to tune in FM radio . You could plug in studio - quality headphones . The Pixel speakers are stereo , but not nearly as loud . There ’ s no FM radio and the headphone audio via USB is lower than headphones plugged into an audio jack on the old phone . A scam to force people to buy expensive Bluetooth headphones and headsets when they already own wired versions of both . The Pixel 6A is a bit narrower than my old phone , which makes the Gboard virtual keyboard narrower ; and individual letters seem even narrower than they need to be . So it ’ s harder to type on . I have not tried experimenting with an external USB keyboard , or any other USB “ on - the - go ” function . There ’ s reportedly no good way to view this phone on an external monitor , unlike most Samsungs for instance . Its chips are faster than my old phone and it has more working memory . I ’ m gradually getting used to the finicky “ upgraded ” Android 13 gesture system , which is better for some actions and worse for others . The phone size suits my needs , it has 5G and high - speed wifi which are definite upgrades . I haven ’ t used it much for pictures or video but it seems competent for those . I was recently at a meeting where people were discussing complex topics , so I tried out the recorder app so as not to miss anything . It not only picked up faint voices pretty well , it also transcribed them to text in real time , with varying levels of accuracy . So there are a few pluses , and I ’ ll live with the phone . But I ’ ll keep my eyes open for some better alternative , rather than waiting a few years for the software support to end . This is not what I wanted when making this purchase , so with all things considered , it is disappointing . \"\n",
      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 2: \" As a preface I did buy this Pixel 6a from Amazon at an amazing budget phone price . I have a still functioning Moto G7 that other than the camera I thought was a way better bargain but wasn ' t supported by Motorola anymore . This Pixel 6a is almost a flagship phone that has what some would consider drawbacks but in many opinions other than mine is a great little phone . My logic in purchasing it is as follows . It ' s a Google phone and the Android OS is theirs and it is as clean as can be with the latest Android 13 on it and it ' s going to be supported for at least 4 years with timely updates . It ' s battery life is good , reception and audio very good and it has a sharp Old display and plenty responsive . The camera combined with the Google software rivals the best and it has a fast processor and more than adequate onboard memory for most people . I like the size of the phone since I am not a large person and the screen is plenty large for me . Games and videos do well on it as it is fine for all but the most very demanding ones . And it is not overly heavy , fits in to a pocket and is well made . For some there are disadvantages such as no wireless charging , no macro or telephoto or wide - angle camera lenses , and although water resistant not 30 minute type and the response is an ok 60hz . But such features require more than twice as much as I paid for it and some of the more expensive phones \" \" features \" \" don ' t perform that well . It ' s well worth considering even at full price . \"\n",

      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 4: \" I gave it three stars for value for money because as we know phones tend to lower in price considerably from one month to another . . . I purchased this 6A to replace my beloved 2019 Motorola edge . I realized that waterfall screen phones may seem kind of a smirky passe gimmick these days . . . But if you have never held the ORIGINAL 2019 Motorola edge in hand you can ' t truly appreciate how beautiful that phone really is . . . It is nearly 90 % screen with no side bezels a tiny forehead and a minuscule ' s chin . Specs wise , even though this 6A appears to be superior ( barely ) . . . in real world performance , this is not exactly the case . . . The moto edge ' s 765g is a surprisingly competent mid - range chip that rarely disappoints and often impresses . If I were to compare it with Google ' s own Tensor chip you ' d be hard pressed to find any real world differences . . . In fact , as it ' s well known , Google ' s chip tends to run warmer and don ' t seem to be as power efficient . . . I have to be really honest in a direct spec wise comparison even though Google ' s pixel ' s specs are superior DO to being latest technology they don ' t seem to perform any better than the previous tech of other manufacturers . I have experienced the checklist of issues others have had with Google ' s pixel 6 phones . If I were to pick a particularly annoying one it ' s the infuriating poor fingerprint sensor , which is completely useless in full daylight and has trouble recognizing fingerprints from different angles . . . If I were to pick a percentage I would say that it fails 60 % of the time . . . And as you can imagine that is abysmal compared to literally $ 150 phones that have more competent fingerprint readers . But it goes beyond that . I eventually decided to leave my beloved motto edge because I felt that it ' s current specs were causing me app misbehavior . ( As well as it having a slightly cracked screen ) But in truth , it seems that these bugs and mishaps were really related more to the apps themselves than they were to the phone . As this phone seems to suffer the same or similar hiccups . . . Even more bizarre is that most of these hiccups appear to be suffered by Google ' s own apps . . . It would take a book for me to describe all my dissatisfactions with the performance of this phone . So much so that I don ' t really see it so much as an upgrade as merely a replacement for a phone that I loved that was unfortunately outdated by time and made no sense to repurchase even though it was available at a superior price to this one . \"\n",
      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 5: \" 8 / 10 / 2022 : So far , I ' m still really enjoying my Pixel . A solid 4 . 5 out of 5 . The biggest drawback so far is one I didn ' t mention originally : the charging time . It ' s not BAD , necessarily , but still slower than my previous 4 - year - old phone . It takes about an hour to charge from 0 % to 80 % . The battery life hasn ' t been an issue , at least ; I can get through a day on about 60 % charge . I ' ve gotten used to the fingerprint sensor , though it is still a little finicky . Regarding overheating , I regularly work in 90 - 110 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time , and I haven ' t had any glaring issues . It just gets a little draggy when it ' s hot . ( And apparently , it won ' t let you use the flash when it ' s warm . ) One great thing I didn ' t mention before are the haptics / vibration . I particularly like them in this phone for typing , etc . I can always feel it in my pocket when I ' m getting a call , which I can ' t say for the last few phones I ' ve had before this one . 8 / 1 / 2022 : I ' ve had this phone for only a couple of days now , but my first impressions are very positive . My previous phone was the Essential PH - 1 , which now has a shot battery , and my biggest struggle in finding a replacement for it was finding a device that was the right size . There are plenty of great phones for this price range out there , but almost all of them are all HUGE . Funnily enough , there ' s already a great review by another previous Essential PH - 1 user , so I ' ll probably end up repeating a few of the same points . THE PROS : - The camera experience is MUCH better on the Pixel than with the PH - 1 . Google phone cameras have never failed me . - The stock - feeling Android experience is great and super snappy on the Pixel , and rather customizable . I love being able to activate dark mode on all of my standard apps . Besides that , it will be receiving updates for 5 more years . - The phone design is sharp and the Sage color is unexpectedly cool . The back feels like glass but is made of plastic , which obviously helps to make the phone feel as lightweight as it does . The buttons are nice and clicky . - I use Straight Talk as my carrier . So far , reception has been great , even compared to the Essential PH - 1 . - The size is NEARLY 100 % PERFECT , but it borders on being just a touch on the tall side . I still like the shape enough that I don ' t mind a bit . I have medium - large hands , and I really wanted to stay with a slim device that fits comfortably in one hand and thrives with single - thumb use . - Some are concerned about the phone ' s 60 hz refresh rate . I ' ve never actually owned a phone with anything higher , so as far as I ' m concerned , the display is buttery smooth . THE MEH : - So far , I haven ' t experienced any overheating or bugs . . . with one exception . For whatever reason , my Pixel did not ship with the Magic Eraser tool in the photo editing app . - Battery life isn ' t exactly life - changing , but it ' ll get you through a full day ' s use after an hour ' s charge , no problem . Even intensive use doesn ' t seem to drain the battery too quickly . - The dual speakers are nice , but I noticed max volume is comparatively sorta quiet . THE CONS : - My only real nitpick with this phone so far is the front / display fingerprint sensor . After owning a device with a rear fingerprint sensor , it feels like a bit of a drawback . The PH - 1 ' s rear sensor provided instant unlock , whereas the Pixel ' s front sensor is barely slower AND a little finicky ; sometimes , it takes a couple of tries for it to recognize my thumbprint . It works decently enough even with a screen protector , but like any fingerprint sensor , I wouldn ' t expect great results if your fingerprint is worn away at all . - It comes with a usb - c to usb - c charging cable , but no charger block . I highly dislike that trend . OVERALL , I am really enjoying the phone and hope it does hold out well for the next 5 years of updates . Even with my small nitpick concerning the fingerprint sensor , I love the camera , the lightweight Android experience , and especially the phone ' s size . \"\n",
      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 6: \" I tried to go budget with the 6a 128gb , but then I was dropping calls like it was the ' 90s ; I had a 100 % fail rate three calls in . After dialing * 611 , two transfers and like . . . 45 minutes , Verizon said it was because my sim card from my old phone was \" \" incompatible , \" \" and they just remotely kicked me and my new phone off their network because they are incompetent . That gave me some time to reflect on the fact that I just needed more room and I / really / didn ' t mind switching carriers for a locked phone deal and a sparkly new compatible sim . I ' m happy with my decision because I tend to leave lots of apps running and have lots of tabs in chrome , and even brand new , the 6a had a little trouble managing that . In particular , the developer options section in settings would lag and freeze , even when I was just scrolling through and had closed most other apps . If you put your phone through a lot , consider going with the 7 or better for the processing capabilities . The only thing I preferred about the 6a was the slightly smaller size ; I have smallish hands and it fit them better . Also . . . if you ' re trying to decide whether to move your physical sim from your old phone or to download an e - sim , you should probably just go the e - sim route .

      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 12: \" Update 2 : Phone would not connect to mobile network ! Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile / data / gps connection , it was such a bummer . After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers , nothing worked - I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one ( same model ) . To my surprise , I have had none of the issues with the replacement . It shipped in a shoebox - size box with no cushioning , which I did not appreciate . But none of the overheating issues ( gets warm but not nearly as bad ) , none of the issues connecting , etc . So , as an actual functioning phone , and not a cause of intense stress : pretty solid ? Not in love with it relative to the original cost , but it looks pretty ( I got the sage ) , and it works about as well as I would expect . Fingerprint scanner is not amazing , but seems to be working noticeably better since update . I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work . Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary , but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough . Battery life is a bit of a disappointment ! Lasts about a day , and not necessarily a full 24 hours . Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra . The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems , I don ' t even notice the difference when it is in use . Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness , and looks good . Camera works well , and even low - light photos come out pretty decent . I would prefer a regular audio jack , but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $ 7 for a USBC / 3 . 5mm adapter . I do wonder about the life of the port , since the power and audio jack are doing double - duty . Verdict : Pretty good phone ! It ruined my life , briefly . _ _ _ _ _ _ Update1 : Google pushed out an update around 8 / 4 , which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while . Phone still gets very warm , but overheating issue is much better . Does not seem to get quite as hot , and also it does not shut down the way it used to . It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations , but I ' ve only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days , when I was using the camera for about a half an hour . This is still a flaw , and not an issue I ' ve run into with other smartphones . General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader . I ' m upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I ' ve had for about four and a half years . The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen , and maybe that ' s why it is slower . If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference . Overall , I am not wowed . Having dealt with the overheating issue , it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery , in case any damage was done by the overheating processor . At this point I am likely to keep the same model , but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case . Not a strong recommendation . Original : I will try update this in a week or so , but it ' s not looking good so far . I have an overheating issue , which is apparently somewhat common with these phones . Luckily I bought a case for it , because it ' s physically uncomfortable to hold without one . When the phone gets too hot , any number of bad things happen - cellular / data quality begins to degrade , or the phone will just shut down on its own . I have gotten some irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating , and then giving me advice on what to do about it . I am not using it to stir nacho cheese , or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano . I ' m not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I ' m doing regular cell phone things , and my phone doesn ' t like it . The \" \" tips \" \" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating , because they already know this overheating is an issue , and they ' re attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue . Anyway , I ' m going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists , but I ' m very disappointed so far . I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud . \"\n",

Overall , 9 . 5 / 10 - extremely solid phone coming from something like a moto g power . CAMERA 10 / 10 10 / 10 , firstly has google camera - an instant boost in rating . While I cant really super - fine tune the pro / manual settings , the camera is good enough where I don ' t really have to . All the major features are there - brightness / exposure , white balance , timed shots , etc . The camera modes included are actually amazing though - night mode was truly a shock to see in action ( yes its that good ) . Google lens is on most modern androids now , and it works fine . the zoom is 5x max , 2x recommended , and it performs decent . the . 7 mode is pretty damn good - especially for video . the stabilization on video is really sick and works surprisingly well . the phone ' s low spec camera is more then made up for in google ' s impressive post - processing capabilities . only thing wrong with the camera is the photo sphere - a feature I was really hyped to try . Dont get me wrong - it works - but not really that well , even with a tripod . Cant expect too much though for a $ 350 phone . PERFORMANCE - 9 . 5 / 10 Absolutley flawless - no sudden restarts , no jitteriness , and any game I threw at it it performed well in . That ' s expected , though , as you ' re supposed to be getting the processor from google ' s pixel 6 and 6 pro . overheating isn ' t a problem , the phone has never alerted me yet , but it can get decently warm . without a case its noticeable and a bit unpleasant , nothing too bad though . with a case its barely noticeable . ill throw voice assistant in here too ; nothing special with it - same quality as any other phone ( this one at least seems to pick up me saying \" \" hey google \" \" though ) . The fingerprint sensor is shockingly good for an under - the - screen one ( first imte I ' ve had one like that ) . Yeah , it screws up sometimes , but nothing that my old phone wouldn ' t have screwed up for either - oily skin , dust , smudges , etc . EXTERIOR & MISC - 9 . 9 / 10 \" \" glass \" \" back is actually really well made , as I ' m sure you ' ve heard already . the plastic does really feel like glass , but has all the benefits of using plastic . the screen is gorilla glass 3 , and has been fine with my one drop of it of like 3 feet . the waterproof rating I ' ve been leery to test what with my old phone , but from YT reviewers it seems perfectly reasonable for its rating . as far as the internal storage goes , its not a problem for me - but might be for most people . I already back up all my photo / video to google photos ( and it is nice to have auto deletion of backed up items on pixel phones ) , but if I didn ' t i ' d already be out of room , especially with the awesome camera . So be warned . If you ' re not a gigabyte - guzzler , though , you should be fie . OVERALL - 9 . 5 / 10 \"\n",

Now I ' m coming from Google pixel 5 which I won ' t sugar coat I absolutely hated ! I only had the 5 because I broke my Google pixel 4a which I loved , the 5 was all around a horrible phone , the battery didn ' t even last half the day , like I literally always had to be around a charger , the phone felt hollow and cheap , just all around I hated that phone , but I absolutely loved the 4a the picture quality the battery life it was a nice budget phone . So I decided I was over the 5 and wanted to get the next budget phone and went with the sage green Google pixel 6a and I ' ve had it now for a couple days and so far Im really enjoying the experience ! It ' s a nice slick phone looks like it could be an expensive phone , the picture quality I already can tell is awesome , the battery lasts me all day I won ' t have to plug it in until I ' m going to bed at night and I use it none stop literally the entire day listening to YouTube and podcasts while scrolling through social media , and shopping online . I only experienced the phone getting real hot and over heating the first day I received it , but I was doing a lot of stuff on it along with downloadong system updates and charging it all at the same time , so it did over heat and was moving real slow . I easily was able to fix that by stopping everything I was doing , stopping the downloads and letting the phone rest on charge for awhile and once it charged I started everything back up with it off charge and it was fine . Since then I haven ' t had any issues with it getting hot . The finger print reader isn ' t the best . . . That does get a little frustrating but doesn ' t change my over all feelings about the phone . Now before I had any Google phones I was a big android fan , I ' ve given iphones a shot and just couldn ' t get into the limitations of the iPhones , but loved what they offered in picture quality I went to Google pixel because I wanted to try them all , got the pixel budget phone and felt like the picture quality was comparable to iphone while still having the android freedom and the price point was perfect ( I break phones far to much to keep spending money on overly expensive phones ) . After trying the pixel I couldn ' t go back . I am now a big Google pixel fan ! Are there things Google needs to do better on ? Yes of course they definitely need to improve some things but over all for the price , the picture quality ( which is a big deal for me , I love taking pictures ! ) and the over all feel of the phone you really can ' t beat it !

Experience with a pixel phone and let me tell you I am in love with it already ! ! ! ! Never will purchase a Samsung or apple phone , I just don ' t do those certain things . Back to Google ' s latest phone release , I am excited ( which I rarely get these days ) when I hit the finger print reader because I correctly setup the finger print reader prior to using it . there is NO issues with any of the pixel 6 series finger print sensors . The only issues are pixel 6 series finger print readers are so accurate of how your finger prints were setup / recorded up prior to using the sensor that if your finger prints are too moist , or your finger prints contain residue on them such as oil build - up from eating something and not washing your hands , or handling something dirty and not washing your hands and drying your finger prints thoroughly will cause the finger print sensors to REJECT the recognition of your finger prints upon trying to unlock your phone . So the best thing you need to do prior to setting up your finger print sensor reader on ANY pixel 6 series phone is too throughly wash and dry your hands prior to setting up your Pixel 6 series finger print sensors . That way the finger print sensors on the initial setup will have your finger prints at their most cleanest and driest state to ensure accurate reading of your finger prints doing the set - up / recording of your finger prints and for the reading of your finger print after the initial setup . The only time I experience error in the finger print sensor is when my hands are dirty , oily , or too moist . And the finger print sensors will ALWAYS deny me access if my finger prints are not thoroughly clean and dry as to how they were prior to setting up the finger print reader sensory . another mention about the Pixel 6a series is the ( sound amplifier ) app . It will greatly enhance your listening experience with earbuds or just the phone speakers themselves so try it out and become amazed . To sum it up , the Pixel 6a with the new google earbuds I received with the pre - order is the best deal I have scored so far this year and I am very grateful to own a Pixel 6a phone . So I will now upgrade to every Google Pixel flagship release starting with the Pixel 7 release . I am sure I will get a good trade - in price for this Pixel 6a being it won ' t be 6 months old when the Pixel 7 is Released . Sincerely , a very satisfied Customer . \"\n",

PROS : Overall , the phone is a decent functioning phone as one would expect , the display is good , the photos are really good and in general it does about as good as most of the pixels I ' ve owned , with a few notable exceptions ( see below ) . I ' ve had a Pixel 1 , and a 3a , and now this 6a , so I have a fair amount of experience with these phones , which is probably why this one is so far a disappointment . CONS : I already miss the headphone jack . I used to plug my phone into my ( older ) computer speakers from time to time , but that ' s no longer an option . I hope the jack comes back in future devices , but it seems like that ' s unlikely . BATTERY LIFE is not good . In the past , my new pixels would last for a day and a half , even under heavy use , but this one can ' t even make it from 7am to dinner time . Maybe the lack of a headphone jack and the extra use of bluetooth is a factor , but I ' m not very happy that I have to recharge a brand new phone at 5pm almost daily . FINGERPRINT READER - this is probably the most noticeable step backward from my pixel 3a . The rear print reader on the 3a was lightning fast and conveniently located . The screen fingerprint reader on the 6a is terrible . I ' d estimate that the phone only unlocks on the first try around 50 % of the time . This is super annoying when you ' re driving and just trying to change the streaming channel . Also , the \" \" stay unlocked on home wifi \" \" feature is either broken on mine or is also terrible , as my phone is constantly locking and requiring me to use the crappy fingerprint reader when I ' m at home . SCREEN BRIGHTNESS - On my 3a I could set my adaptive brightness where I wanted it and it would adjust to differing light conditions nearly flawlessly , but the 6a again , is a step down . Sometimes it goes extremely dark , other times it jumps to 100 % . . . it ' s very unpredictable and almost seems broken . Again , the 3a was a far better device . In closing , I can ' t recommend this phone . I mean , if you ' re using a free phone that came with your wireless plan , the 6a might be a step up , but compared to the past pixels I ' ve owned , this one is hands - down the runt of the litter .

Also , wasn ' t crazy about all the swiping and finger controls , but you can also change that in settings in gestures . Surprised other users are complaining about not being able to charge the battery to 100 % , but I just plug it in when I go to bed . If you have Amazon Prime , I have been watching Thursday night football on it while it is plugged into my laptop and I am blown away by the detail and picture ! So COOL ! No lag time whatsoever .

Simply put it is trash . Other reviewers said Google had fixed this , however , this has not been the case . ( full disclosure - I do use a screen protector ) Upon searching for a fix to this problem , I read that you need to buy a $ 50 google approved screen protector . That ' s ridiculous . For this reason alone , I would not buy this phone . You will need to type in your pin number 95 % of the time you interact with the phone . . . . Trust me - it gets annoying ! especially in the car while you are driving . Also there is NO FACIAL RECOGNITION so don ' t go thinking that is an option . My other problem with this phone is I cannot use a dongle for plugging into a non - bluetooth device . Whenever I do , I get a message saying \" \" not provisioned or supported \" \" or something like that . Aside from those issues this phone does have some positives . Their notifications is on par with Motorola . The battery life is good . The phones speakers are nice and loud . The camera is phenomenal and way ahead of Motorola .

Summary : Poor battery life , photos are inferior to the Pixel 3a I ' ve been using , Tensor processor doesn ' t speed up what I do , not having the headphone jack is a bigger problem than I thought it ' d be . Details next . Because Google is stopping security updates for the Pixel 3a , it ' s time for a new phone . I hoped the Google Tensor processor in the 6a would make the phone faster for things like Google ' s PhotoScan app that do a lot of processing . I haven ' t seen much difference . ( I don ' t use the phone to play games . ) One big problem is the battery life . For simple things like email , phone calls , and web browsing , the battery drains much more quickly than the 3a . ( Note : I use the AccuBattery app to help save the battery by only charging to 80 % . The app says this should more than double my battery life . . . and the 3a battery does seem to last as long as when the phone was new . I need to charge the 6a twice a day ( no , I don ' t want the limits of Extreme Battery Saver ) . I ' m sad that there ' s no headphone jack . I use a wired hands - free in my car to make phone calls , so things like Pixel Buds don ' t help me .

I ' m a serious photographer , and I ' m disappointed in the camera . I ' m glad it still saves RAW ( DNG ) files . The skin tones are a bit better than the 3a . The Night Sight photos have less color noise ( \" \" speckles \" \" ) in the RAW files than the 3a , but they ' re far too dark . Unlike the 3a , the 6a doesn ' t let me turn off HDR - - which I usually don ' t like because it can exaggerate colors . The 6a ' s JPG files can be really ugly , probably because they ' re sharpened more than they were in the 3a . To get really fine quality photos , I ' d be editing lots of DNGs and saving them as JPG ( or PNG ) before I print them big . To show you the ugly sharpening in the JPGs , I ' ll attach small sections of two photos at 100 % magnification . These are from Google ' s PhotoScan app of a painting by Georgia O ' Keeffe . The one with smooth color is from the 3a ; the one with the random patterns and strange - looking edges are from the 6a . I might try a Pixel 5a , but they cost almost the same new as a 6a !

Update : The slow battery charging speeds are what they are but the battery life is actually better than I first gave it credit for . I believe that during the first week or so of using the phone the adaptive battery feature learns your usage patterns and adapts to them to provide a better experience . I still would have liked to have seen a 5000 mah battery in this phone but if you owned a Samsung S20 FE 5g I find the battery life to be very similar to that device . A really incredible phone all around . \"\n",

The camera on my moto G8 is leagues better and even has a professional photography mode giving me more controller 5o better take clear , non - pixalated photos . 4 . Would not connect to WiFi .

The speakers are loud but other than volume up and down , no other audio controls such as bass , treble , or presets like , rock , classical . . . etc .

Today for example , I ' ve been charging for 12 hours and have managed to go from 23 % to 49 % battery . No cord , including the original that came with the phone seems to satisfy the 6A . Meanwhile , the rest of my devices have fully charged again . The 6A is at less than half , not a fully charged phone . I closed everything down , restarted the 6a , walked away an hour ago then came back to find that the percentage dropped from 42 % to 36 % charged , though still connected to the charger . The fingerprint reader which is now on the front of the phone , the glass screen , rarely works . This is a problem for me , as I have issues with my hands shaking , and therefore typing passwords or pin codes is problematic . Being able to place a finger on a print reader is much more efficient and less painful . However , Google ' s reader on the front of the phone correctly reads the print maybe 1 time in 3 , even trying multiple fingers doesn ' t improve that average .

I ' ve been downtown in a major city and gotten no service and I can literally see a cell tower from where I ' m standing .

It downloaded an 8 GB file via data when I was in my home , connected to my wifi and burned through a month ' s worth of data in 20 mins . Interface : If you use the default launcher , you are forced to have a Google search bar on the bottom of all of your home screens . This is not optional . You will also have a permanent widget called At A Glance that can technically be removed , but the space the widget occupied is blocked off so you will just have a portion of unavailable screen space . The app drawer cannot be modified . It will display all apps in alphabetical order . You cannot have folders or hide icons . The recent apps background is also just plain gray . No blurred see through to your background . Just boring , plain gray . Your default screen must be the first screen . You cannot have any home screens to the left of the main one . Charging : while the battery life is good and my phone does not typically die during the day , the perhaps biggest detriment is that this phone does not come with a charger ! And what ' s more , the transfer cable you ' re given is usb - c to usb - c , which means you cannot even use an existing charger brick you may already have .

That is a huge turn off . Let ' s get to the main reason for this return . Three days after using this phone I was unable to make any phone calls and my incoming calls were going straight to voicemail . I could have called tech support again and they probably would have been able to fix this but I didn ' t need to . Are you wondering why ? I thought it would be best to do a factory reset to at least fix the calling features which is usually an important feature for a phone . The factory reset did not solve the calling issue so I returned this phone to Amazon and bought a Samsung a53 . It ' s nice but I still like Google . It just didn ' t work out and now I ' m wondering if I ' ll ever be able to get another Pixel in the future because of this bad first impression . I ' m very disappointed .\n",

Everything on this phone works great ! Is it perfect ? No but no phone is realistically speaking . Calls , texts , a great AMOLED screen , good sound , and great battery life . It all adds up to a solid overall performing device . Some complain about the fingerprint sensor but it ' s optical and not supersonic like high end Samsungs have . All you need to do is give it an extra second or two and completely rest your finger on the sensor and it ' s good enough . Lastly , I ' ve found that if you transfer apps and data from a prior phone , that ' s where you ' ll likely run into issues . I had a Pixel 5a before and transferred my apps and data and had a couple issues with it . I set up this 6a I ' m using from scratch and signed in app by app and while it takes more time , it ' s totally worth doing it to ensure no issues . For the price of this phone , you won ' t find anything in this range ( some higher ) that ' s better . Pixels just work and that ' s all you really need and could ask for . EDIT : A helpful hint on the screen protectors , do your research on which brands work best on the Pixel 6a . Mine is SuperShieldz and it ' s really simple : install the screen protector and DO NOT use the \" \" increase screen sensitivity \" \" option toggle in display settings . Also , once the protector is installed , you need to delete your fingerprints from the security section of settings and re - register your prints . I ' d say my fingerprint reader is as accurate as it was without a screen protector now that I figured out to keep that toggle for the sensitivity off . The fingerprint reader isn ' t perfect but I feel it ' s good enough and I hope adding this little edits helps all those having frustration with the reader once they put on a screen protector . ReEDIT ( 12 / 22 / 22 ) : you can ' t give half star increments so I editing the rating for this Pixel 6a to a 4 but if possible I ' d have made it 3 and a half stars . I tried to remain optimistic about the fingerprint sensor but it only works decently on occasion and is mostly trash . The overall Pixel experience is still pretty good but there ' s little bugs & glitches that definitely cheapen the user experience day to day . I can ' t understand why Google which is a software company , makes a phone that has issues with . . . . SOFTWARE ! C ' mon Google ! You ' re a billion dollar company making budget Android company mistakes , get it together . I ' m trading my 6a in on a Motorola Edge 2022 on sale and it has a better fingerprint sensor & face unlock too . In summary , be aware of Google ' s issues when you buy a Pixel device . My advice is get a Motorola , OnePlus , or a Samsung if you buy Android only devices . Pixel has potential but isn ' t anywhere close to where Google needs those phones to be . \"\n",

But as somebody who preordered it , I got it for an even lower price and they threw in a free pair of Google A - Series ear buds - - regularly sold for $ 99 . For the last four years , I have been using an Essential PH - 1 phone , one of the most underrated phones out there . It has a powerful Snapdragon 835 processor , a beautiful high - resolution screen and a gorgeous build with a titanium frame , ceramic back and a Gorilla Glass 5 screen . They don ' t come much better than that . While the Pixel 6a can ' t match the Essential ' s build , it beats it in several other areas . The Essential phone ' s camera was good . . . as long as the lighting was adequate , but the Pixel has a very good camera . And the camera software is much better . Both phones are about the same width , but the Pixel is about 1 / 2 \" \" taller . One thing I ' m glad about is that the Pixel 6a , which comes with Android 12 , is due to get software updates through 2027 , while the Essential phone is stuck on Android 10 . I won ' t go into all of the new features of Android 12 because I ' ve only been using the phone for 24 hours . But there are some pretty neat things available . As far as the colors available for the Pixel , that ' s not important to me . After all , when you put the camera in a case ( doesn ' t everybody ? ) , you can no longer see the color of the phone . Meanwhile , the front fingerprint sensor on the front screen of the Pixel works OK , but it ' s not instantaneous like the rear sensor on my Essential phone . On the Pixel , it seems you have to press the sensor pretty firmly for about a half a second for it to work . One thing I have yet to test with my Pixel is its reception . I read at least one report that says it ' s poor if you go out to rural areas . The phone is 5G capable , but apparently that is not offered in the city where I live because it ' s not showing up on my phone . All in all I like the phone . It ' s taking some getting used to but I love the new technology it offers and am looking forward to using it . I plan to keep my Essential phone permanently attached to my DJI drone ' s remote control in the meantime ! Update : Yesterday , I traveled to a town about five miles away from me , just over the state line , and was pleasantly surprised to see that 5G appeared on my phone . I didn ' t test it by making a phone call , but I ' m sure the reception would ' ve been clear . I will go there again this week and make a call . Second Update : I went to a supermarket a block away from my house and noticed my phone was on 5G . Don ' t know why I can ' t 5G inside my house . But it does get WiFi calling . To the reviewer who said the can ' t find a case for the phone , did he bother to look ? There are plenty of cases available for the 6a . I bought a beautiful case for it on Amazon made by Spigen .

The key question you probably have is , \" \" should I buy this phone ? \" \" And my answer is a qualified \" \" yes \" \" . It ' s an excellent phone , with a good processor , a decent screen , an excellent camera , etc . But it does give up a few features you ' ll find on flagship phones , most notably wireless charging , a dedicated zoom lens and a better battery . Ignoring the nonsense and pointless specs , here ' s what you need to know : * * Processor : Uses Google ' s tensorflow processor - - the same one used in their flagship Pixel 6 . It ' s fast enough for anything the average person would want to do . * * Memory : 6Gb . Flagships have 8Gb ( and some more than that ) . But 6Gb is more than enough for an average user on Android . * * Screen : A high resolution 6 . 1 \" \" screen sufficiently detailed ( 1080x2400px ) for any use . It only offers 60Hz refresh rate , vs . 90 or 120Hz on other phones . I personally don ' t consider this a big deal , but if you own a 120Hz phone you will notice a modest difference in how velvety smooth certain animations seem . Not a big deal . * * Headphone connectivity : There ' s no headphone port . It ' s the first Pixel \" \" a \" \" series without one , and it ' s a bummer they ' ve removed it . You ' ll need to upgrade to Bluetooth headphones to make the best use of this . * * Wireless charging : This phone does NOT have wireless charging . That ' s kind of unforgivable in 2022 , but of course Google had to create some differences to encourage people to buy the more expensive non - \" \" a \" \" series phones . * * Camera : The camera quality is excellent but not quite at the level of flagships such as the Samsung S21 , the iPhone 13 , or the Pixel 6 . Uses the same lenses as in Pixel phones going back to the Pixel 2 , but with better AI processing and more AI power via the new processor . It supports Google ' s cutting - edge software apps such as \" \" Magic eraser \" \" . It has dedicated standard and wide - angle lenses but no zoom lens . The lack of a zoom lens means any zoom is photo cropping + AI . This is inferior to a dedicated zoom lens . * * Size : It ' s almost exactly the same size as the Samsung S21 ( see photos ) , and sits comfortably in the hand . Those who have struggled with humungous \" \" XL \" \" or \" \" Pro \" \" phones may find this a lot more hand - able . * * Battery life : The battery is 4410mAh . That ' s pretty average for a mid - line phone these days . Battery life needs to be ascertained after giving the phone a few days for OS optimization . At that point , I find that the phone will easily last a 16 - hour day of average use but is getting stressfully close to low at the end of that period . * * Speaker quality : Decidely average . Nothing special , and certainly not best of class . * * Fingerprint reader . This phone has gone to the in - screen reader , same as the Pixel 6 . It ' s pretty mediocre - - slow and not always accurate . Personally , I have yet to use an in - screen fingerprint reader that pleased me and I wish the manufacturers would go back to the reader on the back of the phone . My summary : The only thing that keeps me hesitant about recommending this without reservation as a good midline daily driver is the lack of wireless charging . The lack of that really useful feature is very annoying . But if that doesn ' t matter to you , this is an extremely solid phone at the price point and would compete directly with the flagships phones of a generation or two ago . Pros : * * Good processor * * Decent amount of memory * * Supports Google ' s latest photo tricks ( e . g . Magic Eraser ) * * Sweet spot in terms of handability / size * * Solid build quality * * Clean Google Android implementation * * Competitive price Cons : * * No wireless charging * * No headphone jack * * No dedicated zoom lens for the camera * * Average - sized battery \"\n",

Much better in all aspects . <Battery life:Positive Confidence:0.9995> is decent . The <screen:Positive Confidence:0.9995> is very nice and responsive .

      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 557: \" So much to say about this phone . . . But I will try to keep it as short as possible . My relationship with the Pixel 6 Pro , which has the same exact hardware as the 6A , has pretty much been something similar to a love - hate relationship . Things I love : - All the actual hardware is functional and seems to be designed very well . There are many things which can go wrong here , and Google seems to have done a good job with this at the very least . The display on the pro model is also pretty fantastic , It ' s just the right size for me . Anything smaller is completely intolerable . But most importantly I ' m able to set the scaling of the entire system to be at very high density . This gives tons of realestate on my screen for reading text and doing all kinds of things . Plenty more open room to work with . But most importantly the way it actually looks is quite remarkable . There ' s a certain high quality and professional artistic touch to it all . Especially in certain applications . I only use dark mode and the color scheme I chose which is basically just shades of black and dark gray look absolutely fantastic . I ' m pretty sure this is the best layout of any device on the entire market . All of the UI elements and icons and texts are arranged just ever so perfectly . Also , This phone has completely useful and unique features not found anywhere else such as built - in call screening and automatic hold functions . I love screening callers with an automated assistant at the push of a button . And now for the bad : - Google can ' t seem to make up its mind in terms of consistency in design . Features and settings are constantly moved around and a whole bunch of things change all the time from one operating system version to another . It ' s quite annoying . But most importantly there are plenty of software bugs here and there . Most of which are minor annoyances but they do total together to be something significant . For example , Gmail decides that my connection is not good enough to upload a bunch of photos . The email message will constantly remain in limbo not being sent and there is no options to cancel it or manually resend it yourself . Even if you switch over to a very clear and strong Wi - Fi signal or turn off your cellular radio and turn it back on , it doesn ' t matter . This causes you to manually copy your previous email and then resend it again . But now that other message which was previously unsent does eventually get sent again too . So the recipient is now receiving two very large emails . And this is only one example of the things which can go wrong . . . There are definitely others . But there are also examples of things which seem to be common complaints of people which I have not experienced whatsoever , such as poor reception . I think this may be an issue with how the signal bar is displayed rather than how the phone actually receives reception . I also hear the fingerprint reader doesn ' t work well but I never use it , though this may seem something which is actually legitimate . Though the cellular reception certainly seems as if it ' s not a legitimate issue . There are very specific areas where I live to know what to expect from reception quality . Areas where I know the exact point where I should normally lose reception . And this phone performs no differently than any other phone I ' ve had . I travel with this phone quite extensively and have never had any issues with reception qualities whatsoever . Overall though , I think it ' s a wonderful device . This is really the only unique Arm SOC for the entire Android platform . The common opinion from reviewers seem to be opposite of this , in which they consider the chip to be something like a knockoff of other common Android chips . But this is certainly not true . First off , this has two physical X1 processor cores , and no other chip has this . Secondly , there is an additional ML core for machine logic , which is another thing 100 % unique , not only for phones but for any CPU architecture , but certainly unique for phones . And finally we have the Titan chip , which means all of three things put together definitely make this architecture to be completely custom , And not even remotely close to anything made by Samsung or anyone else . So this is definitely not like a generic Qualcomm or Exynos which are mass - produced worldwide by the millions , where the operating system and software drivers are modified by God knows who , somewhere in Asia . Oh , and I hear that Titan security chip on this device is also pretty fantastic . Also be absolutely sure to get the Google brand 30w charger for this phone . The performance is noticeably affected by lower wattage chargers . And yes I ' m talking about the actual system performance and not just the battery charging speed . I suspect that there is something about the Google brand charger which really kicks those big dual core X1 processors into high gear . Though this is only a suspicion of mine , but I do notice a performance difference when it ' s plugged in . It seems to be much much faster . Quite faster than anything else I ' ve ever seen . \"\n",

By basically being on standby , it still loses most of its battery by early evening . I ran a check of apps that may be draining it but I have none that are any different than the 4 other older phones in our family , yet the new Pixel 6a just drains . . . . and if you actually start using apps , you get to watch the % battery meter tick down quickly . Original review : ordered our 3rd pixel phone as part of a trade - in promotion . they ran 2weeks late sending the tradein kit , which then was past the return window . was assured it would be fine and they ' made a note ' in my account . well , trade in was valued at 0 ( newish iphone ) and they say sorry , youre passed the return window . I know this , that was the concern from the beginning , but they assured me they were aware of their backlog and i ' d be fine . 4 different operators , over 1 . 5hrs , all gave the same script and runaround pretending to pass me to a \" \" dedicated support team \" \" who ' d then repeat the same script and string me along with no resolution . Kudos to them for suckering in people to send in phones , assess at zero , and tell you its too late to do anything about it . never getting another google product . \"\n",

Even though I had to pay a restocking fee of $ 47 it was worth it , as I ' m back using my trusty old LG 7 . The LG has a rear finger print scanner that works 100 % of the time and is fast . Before the update to Android 13 , the finger print scanner was a 50 - 50 chance of working . , and after the update it was even less than that . And when it did work , it was slow . I probably would have kept the 6a , but Google who is big on security , may have messed up on a select batch of 6a ' s finger print <scanners:Negative Confidence:0.9936> , as others have no complaint , but others like me , had issues . My advise to Google , go back to the much more reliable rear finger print scanner and / or include face recognition .

      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 591: \" I thought I would really like this phone , it has a good weighty feel in the hand not heavy , but more like a quality sort of feel and it was 5G . That seems to be about where my fondness for this phone ended . Almost as if a omen of what was to come I struggled with my carrier to set the device up , for like a hour we went round and round about it being supported or not being supported , something I had not been aware of that metro pcs supposedly does not support dual sim card phones , but thats another story and one I have personal experience with , since I had a few weeks earlier set up a Samung S10 international variant dual sim card phone successfully . So I don ' t know but the dual sim card seemed to cause problems despite their online compatability checker saying it was compatable . For me the real deal breaker was when I discovered this phone did not support any of the higher bit rate audio codecs or bluetooth codecs , although present in the menu they where grayed out allowing no access . Before even really using the phone I knew I would never be completely happy with this phone due to this limitation . I suppose it ' s been a long time since I ' ve had a budget - mid tier phone but I was surprised a phone currently being offered at a five hundred dollar price point did not offer the full range of available audio playback and Bluetooth connection options . Having transitioned from a LG G7 , which is one of the few phones which places the audio experience at the very center of its features , I guess I just nievely thought all phones supported a variety of audio codecs , but I was wrong . Among the other things I have grown to intensely dislike about this phone is the interface , it is different from any other android phone I have previously owened and to me does not feel intuitive , frequently leaving me confused as to where to go to preform the most basic of operations . Additionally it does not support wireless charging , or have a micro sd card port for storage expandability , another shocker , I didn ' t even know anybody besides Apple subjected there users to such limitations . I got this phone based on having read positive reviewsof Google Pixel phones in general , and their popularity among those who like to mod their phones , and the ease of doing so . However I experienced very little with this phone that was positive or would make me want to use it or spend any extra time on it other than when absolutely nessacary . I suppose the very last straw with this phone was the addition of a Encased case , which had a built it screen protector . This rendered the phone unable to read my fingerprint and thus requiring me to enter the password every single time I needed to use it , which was very , very aggravating . The screen protector also caused the phone to become inacurate and unresponsive to touch causing me to mash on the screen with increasing force in anger and frustration , until I finally removed the case and threw it across the room . The phone at this point regained its lost responsiveness and was again able to recognize my fingerprint , slow as it was in doing so , at least it could do it . Unfortunately however removal of the case / screenprotector somehow resulted in a crack in the screen less than a day later , after having used the phone less than one week , five days to be exact . I ' m not sure what caused the crack my mashing on the screen in frustration or being in my backpack without a case , it doesn ' t seem either should have but here we are . I guess I would have expected a $ 500 dollar phone to be a bit more durable , offer more features and be a less aggravating experience overall . \"\n",
      "[2023-03-11 19:06:57] (2.1.5) Example 592: \" Firstly , until now I ' ve been a fan of Google tech and was wooed by the Pixel 6a ' s sleek look and comparatively low price . It does have great looks , but oooof it wasn ' t worth it . Within 4 days of owning this phone , it took an 18 inch fall from my pocket ( seated ) to the office floor , hitting the base of my computer chair on the way . Not a single crack or scuff to the glass or exterior case , but the interior display was decimated . Only a few streaks of green and white appear briefly when I push the power button to ' wake it up . ' I was in shock . Functionally , I can still make calls on it using the voice activated Google Assistant . . . but that ' s obviously not worth $ 450 . Google support says that any \" \" impact damage \" \" ( i . e . , any drop or fall ) is outside of covered repairs , which I understand for most situations , but for a phone to be made unusable by such a tame fall seems like either a specifically defective product or a critical design flaw . In comparison , my previous Pixel 3a has lasted years and endured many small tumbles without conking out - - it ' s got zero screen or display cracks and remains completely functional , even if slower than the newer Pixel phones . So , for now I ' m back to using my 3a while I decide whether I can stomach paying another $ 160 to repair the display on a 4 - day - old Pixel 6a without knowing if this fragility is going to be a chronic and increasingly expensive issue . Bottom line : If I ' d known ahead of time that this \" \" budget \" \" phone had such poor durability and was going to cost $ 610 + I probably wouldn ' t have gotten it . \"\n",

Not a fan of how the phone feels in hand . It ' s really slippery , and I don ' t like the extra bit of hardware on the back where the camera is . The size is longer than I ' m used to but isn ' t unmanageable . I normally don ' t use a case on my phone but with this one I think I ' ll have to because of how difficult it is to hang onto . Won ' t get into the exact features unique to Pixel , because I ' m still learning ( Google sends helpful emails on setup , getting to know the phone , how - to videos , etc . which is great for someone trying to come over from an iPhone ) . All that is probably fine . Camera does get sharp shots and it ' s easy to edit photos , which is supposed to be one of the big things with this particular phone . The main aggravations : the fingerprint ID ( and the touchscreen generally ) . The fingerprint ID works maybe 1 / 3 of the time I try to unlock . I even tried redoing the finger ID from scratch and choosing a different hand , made no difference . And unlocking with the numeric code is almost as bad : it randomly fails to register individual digits in my passcode . Every time I need to unlock the phone it ' s a hassle either way . The screen in general is often non - responsive when I ' m trying to touch - select buttons and links ; it makes me wonder if I have a defective phone here or whether there ' s some setting I need to adjust and just haven ' t found it yet . \"\n",

      "[2023-03-11 19:07:16] (2.1.5) Example 14: \" Why do people want to give this phone bad reviews ? Why ? One person gave this phone a bad review because they couldn ' t find a case . Uhh , there are like 500 cases on amazon for this phone . One person said it had a terrible camera , uhh , really ? This seriously has the best camera out of any phone under $ 500 in the US . Another person said this phone feels cheap . . . WHAT ! ? It has a plastic back , yes , but it feels like glass ! I literally can ' t even tell the difference between this phone and the Google Pixel 6 , and I ' m holding them side by side ! They feel almost identical , outside of the 6a being a little lighter . The fact that they were able to mimic a glass back without actually making the back from glass is remarkable , and the design of this phone is top notch . Finally , one review said they couldn ' t get their contacts over . I can almost guarantee you that they never backed up their contacts in the first place ! If they signed into their gmail , their contacts would have come over ! My wife and I have both used this Pixel 6a , we both got our contacts over successfully just by logging in . So clearly they didn ' t realize that they were accidentally saving their contacts to the phone directly and not google . That is probably user error . This phone has flagship performance , it has tremendous software , the best design for any phone under $ 500 , it has a great display , yes it is 60hz but it is a great oled display , and everything is super smooth . Compare that to the iPhone SE , you get that for like $ 30 less . The SE doesn ' t have a night mode , it has worse cameras , it has worse battery life , it has a worse display , way worse , I mean , super small and not even 1080p . I ' m pretty sure the SE only has 3 GB of RAM in 2022 . Yet this phone has a great design , flagship top notch processor , and again , for someone just wanting a good phone that looks good and performs good , this is it ! It ' s not perfect . The fingerprint sensor seems to be pretty reliable , but it is slower than some other in screen fingerprint sensors , and slightly less reliable , but it still works over 90 % of the time for me , and that ' s WITH tempered glass . It does get a little warmer too , so if you live in a really warm climate , I would avoid this phone . It ' s smaller and it ' s packing a processor that does generate some heat . As a user who checks email , browses social media and switches between apps often , I never had much of any heat issues . I also played PUBG for awhile with no heat issues , but some people who play very high impact games for longer periods are reporting their phone getting warmer , or people who live in hot climates . So keep that in mind if you are a super heavy user . Still , even with those minor flaws , I don ' t think this phone can be beat under $ 500 . At least in the US . I am reviewing this on youtube ( check out Android Digest ) but after seeing these reviews I had to say something , some of them are just absurd . If you get a software glitch do a quick factory reset once , or do a software update , this phone just came out and may need a patch or two to stabilize every little bug , but I haven ' t noticed any bugs lately , and it ' s been great ! \"\n",

The galaxy was tempting but after dealing with transferring data and all the bundled apps on my wife ' s new S22 ultra decided against it too . I completely distrust google but in the end decided to get this one as it does have nice features . Was able to quickly change a few of the annoying things , for example how the power button behaves , and by default it was in dark mode which is impossible read in daylight . But the most annoying thing to me was their use of gestures for navigation instead of the circle / square / arrow buttons that I ' ve been using for so long now . The gesture method kept messing things up and getting me ticked off at it . I was thinking I was stuck with the gestures until I did a web search , found out you can enable those buttons again by going into settings - > system - > gestures - > system navigation . There you can re - enable the 3 button navigation . Woo - hoo ! You can also go there to re - enable gesture navigation too if you change your mind later . I bought the Spigen case ( item B09S899Z51 ) and really like it , it appears to offer good protection and it fits perfectly . Button operation is good too . This phone with the case appears to be the same size as the old moto g6 . If they ' d have put the power and volume buttons in the same place on this one maybe could have used my old g6 cover . It came with android 12 and it downloaded a bunch of system updates when I connected it to wifi as well as updates to my apps . It then offered android 13 update which isn ' t going well , after 3 hours it still wasn ' t complete , the installing bar never makes it past 1 / 2 . I paused it and will resume it later someday , thankfully the phone was still usable . Update : After I wrote this let it resume and after 30 minutes it finally finished installing v13 , then it downloaded a few more updates and it was successful . So far it is a lot faster than the old g6 , apps open fast and it seems more responsive . The 128GB storage should be fine , and memory usage is hanging around 68 % of the 6GB the phone has . The camera is taking nice pictures as well . Back to the apps , was using a feit app for the camera floodlight and it was sluggish on the g6 when viewing the motion detected playback videos , on this thing it ' s responsive and not frustrating . \"\n",

And I ' ve been using it about for 4 days now . I post this review as I believe my opinion won ' t change as the product is from Google and is expected to have standards . Pros : 1 . Phenomenal camera . I mean it ' s pixel . 12MP only gives moderate zooming but the picture quality is just camera - like . Even supports astrophotography . 2 . Nice software experience . I like several Google features in this phone . Some are global to android phones , some are pixel specific . I did not expect this much privacy features from a company like Google . Defentiely much better UI ( subjective ) than chinese crap . 3 . Good display . Not 90Hz and it shows , but for a 60Hz display , it ' s very good . For me , not at all a deal breaker . 4 . Aesthetics . Beautiful to look at , at both software and hardware perspectives . I bought the sage green option . Cons : NOT HAVING A CHARGER WITH THE PHONE . but it ' s all phones now , so yeah . crap . 1 . Battery . On a 30K phone , battery can be better . It ' s not too bad , it ' s just not feels like a 30K phone in 2022 . But if you buy Google charger , you get rapid charging so there ' s that . You also have adaptive charging to charge overnight without damaging battery . Do not forget to take charger for longer trips , or turn on battery saver . For emergency situations , there ' s extreme battery saver , so I think it ' s not that much of an issue . 2 . Not true Dual SIM . One of the SIM is eSIM , which is not bad but in a country like India it ' s still not appropriate . For now I use only one SIM in it . 3 . Heat . Any serious multitasking and the phone gets hot . Not for daily use tho , so there ' s that . If you are heavy gamer or use phones like computers , beware . But with the flagship processor the phone feels fast always . 4 . Minor Bugs . I have not updated the phone yet , and the factory OS has some bugs here and there , nothing deal braking tho . And I already have got the android 13 update notification , so I guess this is a minor inconvenience , if any . Overall , recommended Unless you are a heavy gamer or the cons are a deal breaker for you . \"\n",

Display - Good . But the color saturation is much underwhelming compared to my previous phone . ( Asus zenfone 5z ) . 60 hz refresh rate is not of much concern to me . The phone functions quite smoothly . Animations are great . Battery - Back up is very good . You can easily use the for phone for a complete day with 30 - 20 % power remaining . Charging is slow though . Heating issue is almost nonexistent after the update . Sound - Sound is awesome . Adequately loud and deep . Stereo effect is remarkable . Camera - Outstanding feature of this phone . Though I am not too much into photography the pictures and videos I have taken came out really well . Software experience - The best I have experienced so far . Very satisfying . Fingerprint sensor - This must be the weakest point of this phone . A physical rear fingerprint sensor would have been much better than the below average in - display sensor . Gets frustrating at times . One word to describe the experience would be ' satisfying ' .

I have been using this phone for more than one month so , it ' s going to be a detailed review . First I ' d like to discuss the cons of the product which are few & can be easily ignored because its pros outnumber them heavily . Cons - 1 . As it supports only 20 W charging , it takes around 2 hours to get this fully charged . If you ' re shifting from trendy fast charging phones that get the juice for the day within an hour , you ' ll have some difficulty at the beginning . I normally charge my phone in the morning after waking up before heading to office . So , it has done good in my life by reducing my unnecessary screen time in the morning . 2 . Battery life is not that great . I ' m a moderate user . I leave it at 35 - 40 % every night before going to sleep , but wake up to find it has dropped below 20 % in the next morning . If you ' re a heavy user , you might have to get the juice twice a day . 3 . There is only one SIM slot . So , you have to opt for an eSIM for your secondary SIM . 4 . Accessories aren ' t easily available in the local market . If you ' re planning to go for this device , it is advised to buy all the essential accessories like Back cover , Screen Protector altogether because you ' ll have a hard time finding them in the local market . That ' s it for the cons . Now coming to the amazing part - 1 . First of all , this comes with the Brand value of a Tech Giant like Google . That means this device is free from all unnecessary bloatwares , advertisements that come pre - installed with most of the devices . The UI experience is great . 2 . The cameras are killers . This is the first time I found both front & rear cameras equally powerful . Photography is good , videography is even better , stabilization is great . If you like making videos , you ' ll start looking for opportunities to take this thing out of your pocket to shoot . To sum it up , I must say if you ' re interested in a premium phone that comes with a Brand value of Google & you don ' t have a budget for iPhone or other Flagships , there is no other option other than this device . \"\n",

This is basically the BEST Cleanest clutter free android you can buy for 550 $ CAD . It certainly has competition but simply put , non Pixel phones are cluttered with bloatware . The only phones in mid - tier that comes close are some offerings by motorola however i am continually disappointed in Camera performance for all motorola phones both in low light and with the speed of taking the shot . With FAST updates and Android support , I think you should not look further and buy this phone . Folks complain about glass fingerprint sensor - - i do think it ' s improved quite a bit from all the updates . Sept 2022 update also improves upon this . If you have a front glass protector , you should enable the high sensitivity mode if necessary . I personally have the Caseology glass protector and have no issues . It performs on par with my old samsung note 10 + glass sensor . Battery life is average . . . nothing great . Gets me through the day . Camera is basically the best on the Android market at this price in my opinion . I ' ve used mid - tier Samsung . , Motorola , TCL , Huawei , Plus one . . . theyre all strong contenders but I always preferred the photos coming out of Google camera with its computational photography . It keeps getting better with updates and Google doesnt abandon the phone for 2 - 3 years after buying . Other manufacturers are \" \" one and done \" \" and once you get the phone , its RARE to have any improvements ( based on my own observations whilst owning those phones ) A few things i wouldve liked to see : - - I generally would have LOVED to have the wired earphone connector on ALL phones but alas , pixel has gone the way of Bt only ( or usb adapters ) . - - I ' m also going to say I ' m not super thrilled with glass back . The phone NEEDS a case otherwise its slippery and fragile . . - - only offered in 128GB flash . would have liked one of the two phones i bought , to have 256 .

I keep trying to justify to myself how this purchase isn ' t so bad because the phone is beautiful and camera is nice but given the purchase I would never get it again from this seller . Sometimes when I ' m talking on the phone regular phone call , people tell me that my voice goes all weird like a \" \" robot \" \" and high pitched . This always coincides with hearing the little clicks and static . It is very common I hear and feel these little electrical pulses when I ' m on speaker phone . I don ' t even like having the phone near me . I really feel like its the constant sensation of touching a light socket after you ' ve been electrically charged by carpets . When I ' m listening to music with my plug in USB - C headphones I can feel the electrical impulses travel up the cord into the headset . Never in 20 + years of using mobile electronics have I ever felt anything like this . Sometimes when I feel the electrical impulses my hairs stand up on end and then the music pauses itself ! At least once or twice a day the music spontaneously pauses itself , and usually it happens when the phone is in my pocket and I am walking across the carpet in socks . It gives me a really weird feeling . I feel like the electricity impulses are coming from the area where the on - screen finger print reader is . That area under the screen where the bright light comes on . Whenever I feel these static and electricicty sometimes you can actually hear clicks , and they originite always from the bottom 50 % of the screen . Every week this problem seems to become more frequent . I didn ' t notice it much in week 1 , but after many weeks it becomes more frequent . I also even have trouble with people hearing me over the phone when I ' m on speakerphone and that drives me crazy . I have always bought Pixel and Nexus phones and loved the vibrant good speakerphone features but this time I find myself raising my voice and getting frustrated that people on the other side of the line can ' t hear me clearly - while I am listening to static and clicking on my end . I can ' t put my finger on it exactly but I deeply regret my purchase here .
